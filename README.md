# NaiveBayes_Diabetes
First assignment for a Data mining related course. <br>
The aim of this project is to perform Naive Bayes classifier on the diabetes dataset. Explored several model evaluation metrics(e.g. Recall, Precision, f1-score)
## Weka
Applied Naive Bayes classifier on diabetes.arff.

## Python
Naive Bayes on diabetes.csv.

## Keywords
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Recall, Precision, f1-score
* Confusion Matrix
